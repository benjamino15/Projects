# Projects

Welcome to My projects! 

My name is Benjamin and I have recently graduated from my MSc in Econometrics with a specialization in Climate Econometrics. I am looking for a position in the intesection between data science and Climate change and/or sustainibility topics. Here I share the work I've done in recent years to showcase my data science and analysis skills.
