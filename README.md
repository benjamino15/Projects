# Projects

Welcome to my projects! My name is Benjamin and I will soon graduate from my MSc in Econometrics with a specialization in Climate Econometrics. I am looking for a position in the intesection between data science and Climate change. Here I share the work I've done in recent years to showcase my data science and analysis skills.
